# gcam-installation
This package automates the compilation of GCAM on UVA's High Performance Computing Cluster, as well as sets up a structure for querying data from completed model runs

To begin, download the gcam-core zipfile from https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core
You will also need the hector-gcam-integration zipfile from https://github.com/JGCRI/hector/archive/gcam-integration.zip

After downloading both zipfiles, place both in the top level of this folder.  
The scripts included here should automatically move into place and unpack the zipfiles during the build process
