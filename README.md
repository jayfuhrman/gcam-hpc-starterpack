# gcam-installation
This repository automates the compilation/build process of the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) on UVA's High Performance Computing Cluster, as well as sets up a structure for querying data from completed model runs.  It is made publically available to streamline the process of compiling and running the model for the first time, for future UVA researchers. Note that this package was created specifically for use on UVA's cluster, as other clusters may have different libraries installed and/or different protocols for submitting jobs. However, it may be generally useful, with potential modifications, for researchers elsewhere attempting to set up and run GCAM; especially on cluster computing environments with slurm submission protocol.
